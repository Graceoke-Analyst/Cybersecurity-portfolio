# -Cybersecurity-portfolio
 Hands-on projects demonstrating proficiency in SIEM, Incident Response, and Risk Management, powered by practical security analysis using Linux, SQL, and Python scripting.

 ## About Me

I am a results-driven Cybersecurity Analyst specializing in Incident Response, Risk Management, Threat Intelligence, and Security Scripting. This portfolio serves as a comprehensive collection of hands-on projects demonstrating my expertise in applying security frameworks (NIST CSF), utilizing industry-standard tools (SQL for log analysis, Python for automation), and delivering concise, technical documentation.

My focus is on translating technical security challenges into actionable, clear, and documented solutions.

##  Core Skills and Expertise
Security Frameworks- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), Incident Response Lifecycle (NIST SP 800-61), Risk Assessment (Likelihood & Severity)

Scripting & Automation-Python, PowerShell, Bash

Data & Log Analysis-Structured Query Language (SQL)

System Security-Linux/Unix File Permissions.
